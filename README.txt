This file includes data from a thermal demagnetization experiment on Daule L5 ordinary chondrite meteorite material,
Material was measured using a 2G Enterprises 760-R 3-axis SQUID rock magnetometer and PAcquire software on November 18, 2019 at 13:15 EST.
Empty sample holder value (measured beforehand) was automatically subtracted from this data during measurement.
Before measurement, the material was separated from a larger fragment through use of a rotary tool, shaped into a cube (~3mm^3), and arbitrarily oriented.
NRM value is initial measurement to establish a baseline before thermal treatments.
LTD value is measurement after submersion in liquid nitrogen to reduce the effects of multidomain grains (Smirnov et al. 2017). 
The specimen was alternately flipped during thermal treatments (fiduciary aligned with +Z, -Z).


# Thermomagnetic Behavior of bulk Daule material

The three datasets in this file include:
*lt_output.json: Pre-heating low-temperature thermomagnetic data
*ht_output.json: High-temperature thermomagnetic data
*lt2_output.json: Post-heating low-temperature thermomagnetic data

Relevant data labels and units:
*TEMP (temperature), Kelvin
*TSUSC (raw magnetic susceptibility), unitless
*CSUSC (corrected magnetic susceptibility), unitless
*NSUSC (normalized magnetic susceptibility), unitless
*MASSS (mass-normalized magnetic susceptibility), unitless
*TIME (time), seconds

## Sample information and preparation

All data were measured on bulk Daule L5 Ordinary Chondrite (Ecuador) meteorite material on June 18th, 2020. 
The specimen was seaparated from a larger sample through use of a rotary tool and non-magnetic circular heads.
The specimen was then crushed using an agate mortar in pestle and placed into a quartz tube for measurement.

## Instrumentation and corrective measures

All data were acquired using an AGICO MFK1-FA Kappabridge with a CS-L cryostat and CS-3 furnace appartatus at Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI.
Sufyte5 software (http://www.agico.com/text/software/sufyte5/sufyte5.php) was utilized to control the instrument. 
Low and high-temperature measurements of the empty quartz tube were performed before measurement of the specimen.
Cureval software (http://www.agico.com/text/software/cureval/cureval.php) was used to subtract the empty tube data from acquired datasets.
